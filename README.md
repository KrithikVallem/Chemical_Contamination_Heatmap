A website to easily let users view heatmaps of the contamination levels of various hazardous chemicals across the state of Michigan. Try it out at https://esun780.github.io/chem_heatmap.github.io/!

We obtained the data for this website by gathering and analyzing 400,000+ publicly available unstructured EPA datapoints. You can check out the repo for that portion at https://github.com/UMEcoData/Michigan-Chemical-Contamination-Heatmaps! 

**Things we still have to do:**
* Get Descriptions for all chemicals, and update the ones we have currently
* Update the README.md file to indicate the web user tool is finished
* Add in the about page stuff (including header link!!!) and put everyone's faces and descriptions onto it
* Figure out if there are units for the chemical contamination values, and add those in to heatmap and zipcode summary modal
* Look over and finalize the main project description - Note: Some of the technical details behind how the website and heatmap works are misleading, so fix if needed - Heatmap_Tech_Details.txt
* Add a link to the live website on the EcoData website, at the very top of the project description <--- VERY IMPORTANT
* Delete more unneeded files to clean up repo (_config.yml and index.md and Heatmap_Tech_Details??)
