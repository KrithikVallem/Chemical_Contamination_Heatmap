# Chemical Contamination Heatmap
 Chemical Contamination Heatmap for Michigan EcoData

## todo:
* maybe try to find a way to have multiple chemicals on the heatmap at once?, might not work though due to color limitations
* add way to export table of data for specific zipcode
* connect map to input of chemical name
* add slider across years & pass different json styles for each year
* use this for slider: https://www.zingchart.com/gallery/timeline-style-map-with-slider-input
* connect to main website
* change color scheme
* modify other styling parts of the map
